# Computer Architecture Course - Homeworks and Project

This repository contains all the homework assignments and the final project for the Computer Architecture course. The work involves building various processor models in Quartus, exploring cache management techniques in Gem5, and understanding performance improvements in processor design. Each assignment builds upon the previous one, culminating in a project focused on cache optimization.

## üìÅ Contents

1. **Homework 1 - 4**:  
   Developed a single-cycle MIPS processor using Quartus, constructed from basic gates and ICs. The processor supports memory access, jump instructions, and arithmetic calculations. 

2. **Homework 5**:  
   Transformed the single-cycle processor into a multi-cycle processor. This involved modifying the controller and making minor adjustments to the architecture from previous assignments.

3. **Homework 6 - 7**:  
   Upgraded the processor to a pipelined architecture to enhance efficiency. Addressing pipeline hazards was crucial in these assignments, and extensive effort went into handling various types of hazards correctly.

4. **Homework 8 - 10**:  
   Explored cache performance using the Gem5 simulator. Analyzed cache replacement policies, coding style, and other factors affecting cache hit rates and overall performance.

5. **Final Project - Belady's Cache Replacement Policy**:  
   - **Objective**: Implement Belady‚Äôs optimal cache replacement policy in Gem5.
   - **Structure Design**: Built a custom structure tailored to Gem5 for managing cache blocks.
   - **Implementation and Testing**: Implemented the design, ran tests with varied memory access patterns, and optimized the policy for realistic scenarios.
   - **Automation**: Created a Bash script to run benchmarks in parallel, efficiently collecting performance results across multiple simulations.
